# Simon Game

Simon Game is a digital version of the classic memory game "Simon." It tests your memory and pattern recognition skills by challenging you to repeat a sequence of randomly generated colors and sounds. This project provides a web-based implementation of the Simon Game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
